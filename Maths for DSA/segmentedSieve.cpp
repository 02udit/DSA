The Segmented Sieve is an extension or variation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is used to find all prime numbers in a given range [L, R] (inclusive) where R can be significantly larger than L. The Segmented Sieve is especially useful when you want to find prime numbers in a specific range without having to sieve all numbers up to R separately.

Here's how the Segmented Sieve works:

1. First, you use the regular Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the square root of R. These primes will be used as the "base primes" for sieving the range [L, R].

2. Create a boolean array to represent the range [L, R], initialized with all values as "true" initially, indicating that all numbers in the range are potentially prime.

3. For each prime number p found in step 1, mark its multiples in the range [L, R] as "false." To do this, find the smallest multiple of p that is greater than or equal to L, and then mark all subsequent multiples of p in the range.

4. After repeating step 3 for all the base primes, the remaining "true" values in the boolean array represent prime numbers in the range [L, R].

The key idea here is that you don't need to sieve all numbers up to R; instead, you use the base primes to efficiently eliminate multiples of primes within the range [L, R].

The Segmented Sieve is especially useful when R is much larger than L because it avoids sieving a large portion of the numbers that are not in the range of interest.

Here's a simple example in C++ to illustrate the Segmented Sieve:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Function to perform the simple sieve to find base primes up to the square root of R
void simpleSieve(int limit, vector<int>& primes) {
    vector<bool> sieve(limit + 1, true); // Initialize a boolean vector to mark primes
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = false; // 0 and 1 are not prime by definition

    // Iterate through numbers from 2 to the square root of the limit
    for (int p = 2; p * p <= limit; ++p) {
        if (sieve[p]) {
            primes.push_back(p); // Found a prime number
            // Mark multiples of the prime number as non-prime
            for (int multiple = p * p; multiple <= limit; multiple += p) {
                sieve[multiple] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}

// Function to perform the segmented sieve to find primes in the range [L, R]
vector<int> segmentedSieve(int L, int R) {
    int limit = sqrt(R); // Calculate the square root of R for base primes
    vector<int> basePrimes; // Initialize a vector to store base primes
    simpleSieve(limit, basePrimes); // Find base primes up to the square root of R

    int n = R - L + 1; // Calculate the size of the range [L, R]
    vector<bool> sieve(n, true); // Initialize a boolean vector for the range [L, R]

    // Iterate through the base primes
    for (int p : basePrimes) {
        int start = max(p * p, (L + p - 1) / p * p); // Calculate the starting point in the range [L, R]
        for (int multiple = start; multiple <= R; multiple += p) {
            sieve[multiple - L] = false; // Mark multiples of the base prime as non-prime
        }
    }

    vector<int> result; // Initialize a vector to store prime numbers in the range
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (sieve[i]) {
            result.push_back(L + i); // Found a prime number in the range
        }
    }

    return result; // Return the vector containing prime numbers in the range
}

int main() {
    int L = 10;
    int R = 50;
    vector<int> primesInRange = segmentedSieve(L, R); // Find prime numbers in the specified range

    cout << "Prime numbers in the range [" << L << ", " << R << "] are: ";
    for (int prime : primesInRange) {
        cout << prime << " "; // Print the prime numbers found in the range
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
